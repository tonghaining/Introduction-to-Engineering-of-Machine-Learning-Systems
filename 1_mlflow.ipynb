    "As shown in the figure above, the MLOps platform provides an MLflow service that stores ML model training information to a PostgreSQL database and training artifacts to a MinIO storage service. \n",
    "\n",
    "MLflow provides a [Python client](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/index.html) for communicating with an MLflow service. For example, we can use the MLflow Python client to start an *MLflow run*, which is an execution of an ML training script:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with mlflow.start_run():\n",
    "    model = ElasticNet(alpha=..., l1_ratio=...)\n",
    "    model.fit(train_x, train_y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "*MLflow runs* are organized into *MLflow experiments*. An MLflow experiment can be seen as a logical unit of one or more MLflow runs. For example, there can be an MLflow experiment for training an ElasticNet model, and there can be multiple MLflow runs under this experiment for exploring different hyperparameters and/or training datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "When starting  an MLflow run, we can record the relevant information, such as the configured hyperparameters and custom evaluation metrics. After the run is completed, we can also upload the produced model artifact to MLflow:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with mlflow.start_run():\n",
    "    model = ElasticNet(alpha=..., l1_ratio=...)\n",
